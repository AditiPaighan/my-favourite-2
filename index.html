                <p> My favourite hobby is crafting. I like crafting because we can explore many thing like stationary. It contains many things like button, artifitial flowers, leaves, many types of ribbons and laces, etc.<br> <br>And as I said in the starting I llike to hang them out in my room, their are two advantages of it first it makes the room look so beautiful, creative and bright. And secondly it remembers me all the things, even I have stored my art books from my first standard till now. I will always store this sweet memories with me in my further life. <br> <br>
